ArchiMate, an Open Group Standard, is an open and independent modelling language for enterprise architecture that is supported by different tool vendors and consulting firms. ArchiMate provides instruments to enable enterprise architects to describe, analyze and visualize the relationships among business domains in an unambiguous way. Farhad Arbab and Frank de Boer from CWIs Formal Methods group contributed to the design and implementation of the Archimate modelling language and developed techniques for formal analysis.
