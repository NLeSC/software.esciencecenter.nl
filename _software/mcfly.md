This tool enables researchers to try deep learning technology for time series classification with minimum effort. The advantages of deep learning algorithms is that it can handle raw data directly with no need to compute signal features, it does not require a expert domain knowledge about the data, and it has been shown to be competitive with conventional machine learning techniques.
