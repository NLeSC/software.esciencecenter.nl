Timbuctoo is aimed at historians doing interpretative research. Such a researcher collects facts from various documents, interprets and structures them, and creates tables of these facts. The researcher then uses this new dataset either as an object to do analysis on, or as an index that allows them to look at their sources from a distance quickly stepping back to the original source for the real interpretative work.

As such an historian you often need to categorize your findings. For example: you keep track of birthplaces. You then need to decide how to write down the birthplace

* Do you use the name of the city, or the burrough?
* Do you use the current name or the name when the person was born?
* If your dataset spans a long time you might have two different cities on the same geographical location. Are they one name or more?

These judgements are sometimes the core of your research and sometimes incidental to it. Timbuctoo aims to make it easier to publish your research dataset and then to re-use other people's published datasets. To continue the example: another researcher might create a dataset containing locations, their co√∂rdinates and names and how that changed over time. You can then re-use that dataset and link to the entries instead of typing a string of characters that a humand might correctly interpret or not.
