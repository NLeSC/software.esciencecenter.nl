eWaterLeaf is a simple web-based visualization for the eWaterCycle project. It relies heavily on the Leaflet Javascript library, and ncWMS Web Map Service implementation.

eWaterLeaf mostly serves as an exploration tool for the data generated by the PCRGLOB-WB model used in the eWaterCycle project, but it should work with any dataset compatible with ncWMS (NetCDF-CF files).
