OxFrei is an imaging datset which combines the strong features of the well-known  Oxford and
Freiburg datasets. It contains 54 images in 9 structured scenes
each under realistic blur, lighting, scaling and viewpoint
transformations. This is achieved by transforming the Freiburg base images with all homographies of the Oxford dataset.

The dataset allows a transformation-independent robustness
study by comparing performance on all data subject to
the same realistic transformation.
