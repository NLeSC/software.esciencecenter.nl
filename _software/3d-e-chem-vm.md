3D-e-chem VM is freely available Virtual Machine (VM) encompassing tools, databases & workflows, including new resources developed for ligand binding site comparisons and GPCR research.

The VM contains a fully functional cheminformatics infrastructure consisting of a chemistry enabled relational database system (PostgreSQL + RDKit) with a data analytics workflow tool (KNIME) and additional cheminformatics capabilities.

Tools, workflows and reference data sets are made available. The wide range of cheminformatics functionalities are provided in the downloadable 3D-e-chem VM allowing immediate use in research and education.
