Rascal is a domain specific language for source code analysis and manipulation, also known as meta-programming. CWI researchers have started the design in 2010. It is currently being developed and tested at CWI. Rascal is a programming language; such that meta programs can be created by, understood by, and debugged by programmers.  Rascal primitives include immutable data, context-free grammars and algebraic data-types, relations, relational calculus operators, advanced patterns matching, generic type-safe traversal, comprehensions, concrete syntax for objects, lexically scoped backtracking, and string templates for code generation. It has libraries for integrating language front-ends, for reusing analysis algorithms, for getting typed meta-data out of version management systems, for interactive visualization, etc.
