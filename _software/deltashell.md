![Screenshot of Delta Shell](http://oss.deltares.nl/image/image_gallery?img_id=345503&t=1383298647214 "Screenshot") Delta Shell is a free integrated modeling environment with a focus to setup, configure, run and analyze results of the integrated environmental models used to simulate water, soil and the subsurface processes. The software 
components available within Delta Shell are easy to reuse separately, or as a part of an integrated environment. The software can run in a graphical user interface or a command-line mode. Most of the components are developed using 
the C# programming language.
