twiqs.nl provides researchers and students the opportunity to search through Dutch tweets. You can look up words and find out where, when and how often they are used, by whom and with what other words they frequently occur together.

The service is based on an existing system set up at the ISLA (UvA) and the RUG with infrastructure from SURFsara - mapping these tweets is a very compute intensive activity. The Twitter API, providing free access to approximately 1% of all tweets worldwide, is constantly harvested and the resulting data stored. Interfaces to this data provide users with a number of analysis tools that can be run on all content and metadata.
