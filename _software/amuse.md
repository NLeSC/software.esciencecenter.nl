AMUSE is the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment.

Our aim is to provide a software framework for astrophysical simulations, in which existing codes from different domains, such as stellar dynamics, stellar evolution, hydrodynamics and radiative transfer can be easily coupled.

AMUSE is a community effort with the main development by the AMUSE team at Leiden Observatory under supervision of Simon Portegies Zwart.
