These modules provide functionality to detect salient regions in images. Salient regions are features in the image that stand out to the human eye, and thus can be used to give a description of the image. The detected regions could for example be used to match images from the same object, taken under different conditions. These salient regions are invariant under transformations such as blurring, light change and rotation.

The software is implemented both in Matlab and Python. The python code can be installed as a python package to use in your application.
