Xenon is a middleware abstraction library. It provides a simple
programming interface to various pieces of software that can be used to
access distributed compute and storage resources. pyxenon is the Python
wrapper to Xenon.

# Why Xenon?

Xenon is developed by the Netherlands eScience Center as a support
library for our projects. Several projects develop end-user applications
that require access to distributed compute and storage resources. Xenon
provides a simple API to access those resources, allowing those
applications to be developed more rapidly. The experience gained during
the development of these end-user applications is used to improve the
Xenon API and implementation.
