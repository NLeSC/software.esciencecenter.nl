This powerful approach can mine patterns in completely different domains. It can classify musical styles of pieces of music and identify unknown composers. It can identify the language of a text. It can discover the relationships between species of life and even the origin of new unknown viruses such as SARS. In fact, this method requires no background knowledge about any particular classification.
