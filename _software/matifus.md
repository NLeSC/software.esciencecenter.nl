Image fusion methods aim to combine images in such a way that all the salient information is put together into (usually) one image suitable for hum an perception or further processing. An important example is that one and the same scene is recorded by cameras o perating for differ ent bands of light (e.g. infrared and visible light). Many applications exist in the areas of defense, surveillance, medical imaging, remote sensing etc. Multiresolution decomposition has become an im portant means wi thin the devel opment of image fusion methods.  Wavelet methods for instance are eligible because of the spatial localization and hierarchy in scaling. MATIFUS is a MATLAB r © toolbox f or image fusion, based on various multiresolution decomposi- tions and fusi on schemes.
