RooFit is a module in the ROOT package that allows for the interactive and flexible modeling of complex physical processes and the subsequent fitting of physical parameters to collision data from particle physics experiments. A prime current example is the Higgs boson experiment carried out by the ATLAS and CMS detectors at CERN.
