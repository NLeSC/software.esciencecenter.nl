Earth System Models (ESMs), such as EC-Earth, are currently the only way of providing society with information on the future climate. EC-Earth generates reliable in-house predictions and projections of global climate change, which are a prerequisite to support the development of national adaptation and mitigation strategies.

EC-Earth is developed as part of a Europe-wide consortium thus promoting international cooperation and access to wide knowledge and data base. It further enables fruitful interactions between academic institutions and the European climate impact community.

EC-Earth made successful contributions to international climate change projections such as CMIP5. Ongoing development by the consortium will ensure that increasingly more reliable projections can be offered to decision and policy makers at regional, national and international levels.

A new version of EC-Earth is under development and the consortium plans to participate in CMIP6.

EC-Earth is a Europe-wide consortium and welcomes additional partners.

The consortium is lead by a Steering Group planning and coordinating the development of the model and the consortium.
