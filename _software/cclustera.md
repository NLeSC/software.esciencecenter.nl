CClusTera enables interactive and web based 3D visualization of hierarchically clustered data. The application also enables colorizing points based on features other than their clusters.


# Why CClusTera?

In many scientific domains data is hierarchically clustered based on similarity, primarily because of the large volume of data. A scientist would be then interested to view the clusters by expanding and collapsing the clusters, by loading data  up to a certain level in the hierarchy, or by colorizing the data based on features other than their clusters. This can provide new insights for domain research.
