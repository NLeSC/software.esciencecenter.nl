The international research programme HIRLAM (HIgh Resolution Limited Area Model) is a research cooperation of European meteorological institutes. The aim of the HIRLAM programme is to develop and maintain a numerical short-range weather forecasting system for operational use by the participating meteorological institutes.
HIRLAM Management Group with Frits Brouwer Director General at KNMI 2012

The programme was initiated in 1985 and has gone through numerous phases in the past two decades. Since 1 January 2011, the programme has entered a new phase, HIRLAM-B (see the Memorandum Of Understanding HIRLAM-B ). The model which is the focus of HIRLAM-B research activities is the non-hydrostatic convection permitting model HARMONIE. This is being developed in close cooperation with the ALADIN consortium and Météo-France, building on model components that have largely been developed previously in these two communities.

The consortium is lead by a Steering Group planning and coordinating the development of the model and the consortium.
