MonetDB is an open source column-oriented database management system developed
at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was designed
to provide high performance on complex queries against large databases, such as
combining tables with hundreds of columns and multi-million rows. MonetDB has
been applied in high-performance applications for online analytical processing
(OLAP), data mining, GIS, text retrieval, sequence alignment processing and in
earth observation applications.

# Why MonetDB?

MonetDB is DBMS which provides storage model based on vertical fragmentation,
a modern CPU-tuned query execution architecture, automatic and self-tuning indexes,
run-time query optimization, and a modular software architecture. It has been
used by the Netherlands eScience Center for efficient spatio-temporal analysis.

With in-house expertise on MonetDB architecture, the Netherlands eScience center
contributes to the design, research and implementation of new functionality to
support geo-spatial applications. Architectural improvements and new Geo-spatial
functionality, following OGS standards, were added to provide efficiency and
scalability to applications running on top of PostGIS or other commercial Spatial
DBMSs.
