At the center we developed Xenon library which can be used to submit calculations to schedulers or batch queue systems on high performance computing infrastructure like clusters. Xenon requires Java programming knowledge. To make the Xenon schedulers available in other languages than Java a web service was made called Osmium. With Osmium calculations can be submitted using any programming language to any of the Xenon supported schedulers.
