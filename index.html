<h2>eStep: the eScience Technology Platform</h1>

<p>
An important aspect of eScience is the development of new software technologies to enable scientists to make new scientific breakthroughs. The route from data to information to insight should take optimal advantage of modern ICT facilities and e-infrastructures. This often requires specialist knowledge which is beyond the level of expertise of domain scientists. Our aim is to let researchers be engaged with scientific challenges rather than with the idiosyncrasies of ICT.
</p>
<p>
The main aim of the eScience Technology Platform (eStep) is to scout, adopt, research, develop, integrate and make available an extensive and stable set of advanced scientific software technologies. These can take the form of compute kernels, interfaces, libraries, tools, and scientific workflows. Tools in eStep help to manage large collections of data, utilize advanced compute infrastructures, storage facilities, high-speed networks, high-resolution visualization equipment, and instruments.
</p>
<p>
eStep explicitly aims to promote the exchange and re-use of best practices and to prevent fragmentation, duplication. Therefore, eStep contains software that is developed in-house, but also externally developed software that we have expertise with. A key idea behind eSTeP is to have high-level, and sometimes domain-specific, solutions on top of generic low-level libraries, thus maximizing software re-use.
