  description: Prof. Barend Mons is Professor of BioSemantics and founder of the BioSemantics
    group at the LUMC. Next to his leading role in the research of the group, Barend
    plays a leading role in the international development of 'FAIR data stewardship'
    for biomedical data. For instance, he is head-of-node of Elixir-NL. Elixir is
    a pan-European project to develop and foster bioinformatics infrastructure across
    the member states. The focus of the contribution of the BioSemantics group is
    on developing an interoperability backbone for biomedical applications in general
    and rare disease in particular.

The ODEX4all project aims at the development and sustainability of an environment where diverse sources of (big) data are published so that both computers and humans can 'understand' and process them effectively. To that end, semantic web and computer sciences are combined.
