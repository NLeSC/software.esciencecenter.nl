tagLine: A mystery of modern astrophysics
---
In our largely unchanging Universe, highly dynamic components were
recently discovered: flashes of bright radio emission that last only
milliseconds. Some of these radio bursts can be traced to nearby
neutron stars, providing insight in physics environments far more
extreme than any Earth laboratory. Other bursts however, apparently
originate far outside our Galaxy, and must be exceedingly energetic.

These bursts are buried far below the instrument noise. Through
processing algorithms that for example recognize tenuous intergalactic
matter, and through subsequent classification in a many-parameter
space, the project leader's team already made a series of
ground-breaking detections, resulting in 6 Science and Nature
papers. Still the origin of the extragalactic bursts remains a mystery
at the forefront of modern astrophysics.

The goal of this project is to understand both kinds of luminous
bursts. The project leader's team started a highly innovative survey,
ALERT, with the rejuvenated, upgraded Westerbork Telescope - the most
sensitive such experiment in the world by over an order of
magnitude. ALERT includes a 75-GPU cluster and 10 PB storage.

How to match this jump in observational and compute capabilities with
a similar leap in real-time data analysis? A team of eScience Research
Engineers and Astronomers will investigate how to first Accelerate to
real time; and how to then most insightfully Access the resulting
data, and trigger global telescope follow up. Through that unique
combination, AA-ALERT could help shed light on the nature of these
enigmatic radio bursts for the first time - evaporating primordial
black holes; explosions in host galaxies; or, the unknown?
