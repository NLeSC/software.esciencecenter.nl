# Visualizing the level of international readability of works of fiction

The impact of globalization on culture and literature is quite significant. However, works of fiction still face stumbling blocks when translated to for readers from another culture. In many cases, when reading a book from another culture, the reader is required to have at least some knowledge of persons, places, or events from that other culture. Some names will be universally known, such as New York or Angela Merkel, but others will be mostly unknown and perhaps even mysterious, such as Monnikendam or Meneer Beerta. We could therefore ask the question of how “international” a work of fiction actually is.
Measuring how “international” a work of fiction is

If we want to know how “international” a work of fiction is, we first need to understand which textual features play a role in how readable a work of fiction for readers from a different culture. Which of these features can be identified and measured in a digital text (and which not)? And how can the identifiable and measurable features be turned into a usable indicator of readability for readers from other cultures?
