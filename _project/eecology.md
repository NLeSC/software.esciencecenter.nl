# Bridging the gap between the worlds of ecology and technology

This project shows that ecology is evolving into a data and computationally intensive science with the amount of (heterogeneous) data included for analysis increasing rapidly with time. Traditionally, ecologists are not trained in coping with the massive amounts of data that result from data sharing, sensor networks and the incorporation of environmental data into ecological research. Generally, the methodologies ecologists use for management, visualization, exploration, analysis of data are often not suited to cope with large data sets. The challenge of the eEcology project is to bridge the gap between the worlds of ecology and technology. Virtual Labs (VLs) will help to bridge this gap as they support scientific collaboration through facilitating data access, data integrity and quality control, data post-processing, data storage and backup, data merging, data sharing, interactive data visualization, and data analysis.

# The Bird Movement Modeling Virtual Lab

Most effort has gone into the Bird Movement Modeling Virtual Lab. This Virtual Lab has a growing international user community, whose users are mainly field biologists using the VL to track individual birds. In the VL, the track data from the UvA-BiTS system can be combined with, for example, landscape data, weather data, and tidal data to gain new insights on the influence of the environment on the birdâ€™s behavior.
