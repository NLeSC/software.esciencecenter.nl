In modern radio telescopes, System Health Management (SHM) systems are
crucial for (early) detection of errors and for remedying them. Due to
the increasing scale and complexity of the systems involved, the
effectiveness and efficiency of current day SHM approaches are
limited. Therefore, intelligent automated SHM approaches would
significantly improve the quality and availability of the
observational systems.

This is not only beneficial for maintenance, operations, and cost. It
also is crucial for the scientific results, as accurate knowledge of
the state of the telescope is essential for calibrating the
system. Data analytics and more specifically Machine Learning (ML)
have shown to be able to "learn" from data.

The purpose of this project is to investigate the applicability of
novel approaches such as ML for SHM in radio astronomy. Although this
project focuses on application of this technology in radio astronomy,
similar problems arise in scientific instruments across many
disciplines, such as high-energy physics, ecology, life sciences and
urban planning.


Similar problems also occur in large-scale simulations, for example in
water management, computational chemistry and climate science. In this
alliance, a generic methodology will be developed which is also
applicable in these fields.
