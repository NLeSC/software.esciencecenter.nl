Food demand is projected to increase by 50% in 2030. One way to tackle this challenge is by breeding new crops to ensure food security; crops, for example, that are more resistant to drought. Genetics research is increasingly focusing on mining genome annotations to identify the genes that are likely to be responsible for specific traits we would like to see improved. Since these annotated genome datasets are growing exponentially, and as humans are unable to quickly and easily convert this data into useful information, an eScience infrastructure will be designed to process all this data effectively and make it insightful.
