SIM-CITY will study and develop an agent-based complex network system to interactively explore socio-economic scenarios that can support decision makers of large urban areas, notably greater Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Bangalore in India. The research will provide a decision support infrastructure for three case studies - the Relationship between the Urban Poor and the City in an Increasingly Urbanizing World; Dense City Infectious Disease Pressure; and Evacuation Strategies in Case of Emergencies. In the last case study for example, geographical information system data about the road network in the city will be collected, along with spatial data from the different emergency services, and the capabilities of the emergency services (for example for hospitals: specialty of the hospital, number of beds, number of ambulances, etc.). This will then have to be overlaid with the traffic data we wish to collect through the traffic authorities in the city.
