tagLine: Making breakthroughs in data-driven research
---
This project addresses several research challenges in computer science
specifically needed to make breakthroughs in data-driven research. The
project is focused on the data explosion problem, which is one of the
most important challenges in almost all areas of science. The sheer
volume and the distributed nature of many data sets lead to
complicated technical problems around data transport and
data-processing. The data also becomes more complex and heterogeneous,
especially when different data sets are combined from various
instruments and databases, which is typical for system-level
sciences. In particular, this complexity makes it a challenge to
extract semantically useful information from the data.

The parallel and distributed computing environments on which
applications have to run also are changing drastically at all levels,
from processor architectures (multi-cores like GPUs) to networking
(hybrid networks, sensor networks), storage architectures, and
middleware (virtualization and Clouds). The project divides focus
between the volume aspect of the data explosion (big data) and the
complexity aspect (heterogeneous data). One postdoc works on
infrastructure innovation and distributed data processing (especially
on many-cores such as GPUs) and a second focuses on information
management, in particular complexity analysis of scientific data sets
for various disciplines.
