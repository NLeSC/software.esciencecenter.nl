The operational global hydrological model built in the eWaterCycle project has all central features, such as near real-time data assimilation and global coverage. An important feature of the eWaterCycle system is its ability to predict flooding. One of the biggest challenges remaining is the scaling up of this system, in particular the Data Assimilation. In this project methods and software will be developed for handling DA on a large scale. The result will be an operational global model that produces detailed flood predictions around the globe.
