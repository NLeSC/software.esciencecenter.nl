# Medical experts helping machines diagnose

Crowdsourcing, the process of soliciting contributions from a large group of people, and especially from an online community, to obtain content, services or ideas, is increasingly used to subdivide tedious work. Annotating medical texts is one example of such tedious work.

While cognitive computing systems such as IBMâ€™s Watson can process data and text together to give data more meaning and enable deeper analysis, these cognitive computing systems require large amounts of human annotated data (gold standard data) for evaluation, testing and training. Collecting this annotated data is the most expensive and time consuming part of building cognitive computing systems. The Dr. Watson project aims to motivate a community of medical professionals to build a collection of gold standard medical text annotations. It is the first larger scale pilot study in an innovative interdisciplinary research project using crowdsourcing, motivation and gaming techniques to engage medical professionals in the collection of valuable gold standard annotation data.
