If you would know that ten days from now a flood will be at your doorstep, what would you do? You would have time to prepare emergency measures but also move your belongings to higher grounds. It might even be possible to sacrifice inexpensive farmland to save a central business district. Ten days can make a major difference. This is exactly the aim of the eWaterCycle project: to predict flood and drought events 10 days in advance, worldwide and in high resolution. The featured movie shows a setting in which the city of Mandalay is saved from a hypothetical flood. The model can act as an early warning system and enable companies, people and governments to prepare for the rising water.

Providing vital information to the world's population

With climate change, growing population and increasing pressures on land usage, water management is quickly becoming one of the world's major problems. Increased urbanization of delta areas in particular is making more and more people vulnerable to flooding.

The Dutch have historical expertise and interest in water management. In the eWaterCycle project, researchers from Delft University of Technology, Utrecht University, and the Netherlands eScience Center are cooperating to build a high resolution, realistic model of the World's supply of fresh water. Using this model it will not only be possible to build a flood early warning system, but also predict the effect of unsustainable water supply usage, provide support to local governments in making decisions on water protection measures, and provide other information vital to the World's population.
