DTL is a nationwide platform formed by an increasing number of life science partner institutions and companies in the Netherlands. The overall aim of DTL is to coordinate super-institutional approaches to enable integrated life sciences research through the combined deployment of different analytical techniques and/or parallel analyses, including computational approaches, on the various molecular and structural organisational levels in cells, tissues and organisms.
