A democratic society like the Netherlands needs right-minded, actively engaged citizens who have a good sense of their own identity and are able to make responsible decisions. However, it is difficult to get citizens involved in their society if they have no idea of how it came into being, and no understanding of its workings. Cultural participation and solid, up-to-date education in history, language and cultural subjects are of crucial importance in this context. And the foundations of these matters are laid by high-quality humanities research. As the Netherlandsâ€™ foremost humanities research institute, the Huygens Institute of Netherlands History (Huygens ING) plays a prominent role in this process.
