Vincent graduated in Human kinetic technology (BEng) at The Hague University of Applied Sciences and in Human movement sciences (MSc with cum laude) at the VU University in Amsterdam. In 2008 Vincent moved to England to complete a PhD in Epidemiology at the MRC Epidemiology Unit within the University of Cambridge. Vincent did a post-doc at the Institute of Cellular Medicine within Newcastle University.

Central theme of Vincentâ€™s work has been the development of scientific software and algorithms to process data from wearable movement sensors. Vincent pioneered the analysis of data collected with human wrist-mounted high-resolution accelerometers that have been implemented since 2007 in population research on daily physical activity and sleep. Over the years Vincent published on various methodological issues relating to this topic. Further, Vincent has co-authored publications on the first large scale implementation of the technology by scientists in Brazil and the United Kingdom. He released his code as open access software in R package GGIR.

Vincent joined the Netherlands eScience Center in 2015.
