Mateusz obtained his master degree in Biotechnology with specialization Biophysics, at the Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland. He used live cell imaging techniques and fluorescence confocal microscopy to study the dynamics and structure of cell nucleus. During this period, he spent 6 months in the Centre de Biophysique Moleculaire, CNRS in Orleans, France. Mateusz worked there on a model of gene transfer in endothelial cell monolayer exposed to steady laminar flow. After obtaining his master degree, he continued research in live cell imaging in Krakow, but focusing more on automated microscopy image analysis.

Mateusz engaged in collaboration with Eric Manders at van Leeuwenhoek Centre for Advanced Microscopy at University of Amsterdam and worked on MATLAB software for control of a prototype wide field CLEM microscope.

In 2010, he moved to Amsterdam and worked at the RNA Biology & Applied Bioinformatics unit, University of Amsterdam in the Virtual Laboratory for Plant Breeding project. Mateusz worked on the development of an interactive visualization for allelic variation in crop plants and on next generation sequencing data analysis. Mateusz has been active in the Dutch bioinformatics community mostly via NBIC bio-assist. 
Since 2013, he continues working in the Virtual Laboratory for Plant Breeding project as an eScience engineer on behalf of the Netherlands eScience Center. Mateusz works on the implementation of NGS data analysis pipelines and on development of new data analysis methods for Ion Proton platform.

Mateusz enjoys programming in Python, R and JavaScript. He likes experimenting with new ways to visualize data in order to facilitate biological discovery.
