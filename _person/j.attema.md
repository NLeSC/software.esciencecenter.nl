Jisk studied physics at the University of Groningen, graduating with honors from the theoretical physics program. After that he did his PhD on the topic of numerical solid state physics at the university of Nijmegen. His thesis focuses on the search for new (magnetic) materials for use in the semiconductor industry; this by using computational methods (density functional theory). This ignited his passion for high performance computing and big data. After finishing his PhD Jisk worked at SURFsara, the national HPC and e-science support center.

Crossing the line between physics and computation science again, Jisk worked several years at the Dutch national weather office (KNMI). As a member of the regional climate department he worked on improving and optimizing the (regional scale) climate model, as well as repurposing the high-resolution weather model for climate research. He also contributed to the KNMI climate scenarios for the Netherlands, and then joined the NLeSC to work as engineer on the Summer in the City project.

Jisk is also eScience Coordinator for the digital humanities and social sciences projects, aswell as some physics and beyond projects.
