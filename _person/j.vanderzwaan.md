In 2014, Janneke van der Zwaan obtained her PhD in Human-Computer Interaction at the Delft University of Technology. During her PhD research, she explored how Embodied Conversational Agents can provide emotional support in non task-oriented contexts by designing, implementing, evaluating a prototype of an 'empathic virtual buddy' that provides emotional support to victims of cyberbullying between the ages of 10 and 14.

Janneke has a background in Artificial Intelligence (2006, University of Amsterdam, cum laude) and Science Communication (2008, VU University), but started her academic career in humanities (Dutch Linguistics and Literature, University of Amsterdam).

At the eScience Center, she works as an eScience engineer on the Texcavator and From Sentiment Mining to Mining Embodied Emotions projects.
