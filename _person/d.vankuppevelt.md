Dafne studied Computer Science and Mathematics at Utrecht University. During her master studies, she focused on Machine Learning and Data Analytics. Her master thesis was on recognizing product names using Conditional Random Fields, which she developed during her internship at VigLink in San Francisco.

After graduation, Dafne worked at ING as a Data Scientist, where she further developed her skills in Machine Learning and applied them to different business problems. She also got interested in distributed Machine Learning for big data sets, using tools like Spark.
