Ronald joined the Netherlands eScience Center in 2015 to work as an eScience research engineer on the ERA-URBAN project. The project is aimed at developing an environmental re-analysis specifically on the scale of the urban environment, a long-term archive of urban energy and water balances at very high resolution (~100m).

Ronald studied aerospace engineering at the Delft University of Technology. During his masters program he specialized in data analysis, remote sensing and Earth systems. He worked on the detection of anthropogenic changes in terrestrial water storage using a combination of hydrological models and remote sensing data. 

After his masters he joined the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) to do a PhD. During his PhD research, he assessed the ability of climate models to correctly simulate precipitation using statistical techniques. Ronald defended his PhD “Assessment of uncertainties in simulated European precipitation” in March 2015.

Ronald is also a core developer for the Arch Linux project, a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that tries to Keep It Simple.
