In March 2014 Romulo joined Netherlands eScience Center after his post-doctoral research at IBM Almaden research center.

On March 2013 he received a PhD degree from the University of Amsterdam entitled "The DataCyclotron: Juggling data and queries for a data warehouse audience". The research was conducted at CWI Database group place where he also worked in several other projects such as SkyServer, DataCell and Recycler. In the latter the team was awarded with a SIGMOD best paper runner-up award in 2009. During his PhD Romulo was a student assistant for the course Advanced Database Techniques from September 2006 until February 2009 at the University of Amsterdam and in 2011 he did a summer internship at Extreme Computing Group, Microsoft Research Redmond with Roger Barga. With interest in distributed systems and networks, between January 2009 and July 2010 he worked on a collaboration with Jens Teubner and Philip Frey from ETH Zurich on the development of the RDMA-part of Data Cyclotron.

In January 2013 he joined IBM Almaden for his post-doctoral research. At IBM he worked on Big SQL 3.0, an SQL on Hadoop offering that leverages IBM's state-of-the-art relational database technology, without imposing any database structures or restrictions, hence keeping the exibility of Hadoop. Big SQL 3.0 injects IBM database technology for query optimization and execution to provide high performance SQL over Hadoop data.

Romulo joined the Netherlands eScience Center as core eScience engineer responsible for data management systems and architectures. He works on research, design and implementation of data handling solutions for Big Data problems such as spatio-temporal data analysis on Earth Observation.
