Oscar did Telecommunications Engineering in the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) in Barcelona. Later on, he obtained a Master's degree in Astrophysics, focusing in software engineering challenges in astronomical projects.

Oscarâ€™s background is development of software systems for the management, processing and analysis of Big Data. In the first years of his career, he has been involved in astronomical projects. Initially in the development of a distributed analysis tool for the simulators of the ESA's Gaia space mission. More recently, he has been in charge of the data management of the LOFAR Epoch of Reionization project, which meant the development of a database system for the indexing of the petabyte-scale data handled by the project (among other things). The system, together with some additional tools, was used to ease the processing of the data.

Oscar has realized that the skills acquired in astronomy projects can also be applied in many other areas that also fascinates him. That is the reason that he recently joined the project "Massive point clouds for eScience" where he will be part of a team in cooperation with the TU Delft OTB.
