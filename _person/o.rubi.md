Oscar did Telecommunications Engineering in the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) in Barcelona. Later on, he obtained a Master's degree in Astrophysics, focusing in software engineering challenges in astronomical projects.

Oscar's background is development of software systems for the management, processing and analysis of Big Data. In the first years of his career, he was involved in astronomical projects. Initially in the development of a distributed analysis tool for the simulators of the ESA's Gaia space mission. More recently, he was in charge of the data management of the LOFAR Epoch of Reionization project, which meant the development of a database system for the indexing of the petabyte-scale data handled by the project (among other things). The system, together with some additional tools, was used to ease the processing of the data.

Oscar has realized that the skills acquired in astronomy projects can also be applied in many other areas that also fascinates him. That is the reason why he joined NLeSC in 2013. He has been the principal eScience researcher for several projects related to point cloud data, concretely "Massive point clouds for eScience", "Mapping the Via Appia in 3D" and "Improving Open-Source Photogrammetric Workflows for Processing Big Datasets". He also contributes to the eStep platform with libraries and knowledge for Geospatial analytics.
