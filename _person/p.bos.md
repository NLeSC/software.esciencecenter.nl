Patrick has studied astronomy and philosophy and is finishing his PhD in cosmology at the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute of the University of Groningen. Patrick has worked on theoretical and observational problems in cosmology and extragalactic astronomy and has always taken a strongly computational approach.

As an undergrad he used automated galaxy detection codes and the Astro-WISE database and later on focused on N-body simulations and structural analysis/visualization thereof. During his PhD, Patrick developed a Bayesian framework for inverting gravity to reconstruct the (ensemble of possible) initial conditions of the universe.

Patrick joined the Netherlands eScience Center as an eScience Engineer in August 2014, where he has worked on Digital Humanities projects PIDIMEHS and HADRIANVS. From May 2016 he started work on using parallelization techniques to accelerate RooFit, a collaborative statistical model used for particle physics experiments, like the ATLAS and CMS detectors that were used to determine the mass of the Higgs boson.
