Jason studied Computer Science at the VU University Amsterdam, where he graduated cum laude in 1998. The focus of his PhD research (1998-2003) was on developing object oriented programming models for parallel and distributed 
programming. Between 2003 and 2012 he has participated in several research projects, where he has looked at a range of topics related to large scale distributed computing. During this time he has developed a monitoring system for a world-wide 
Grid, robust communication libraries, programming models for computing on heterogenous distributed systems, and several eScience applications that use dynamically allocatable lightpaths. 

Jason joined the NLeSC in 2012, where he has worked as an eScience Engineer on the eSalsa, Extreme Climate Change and Jungle Computing projects. From 2013 to 2015 he was an eScience Coordinator managing several eScience Engineers 
and projects. From 2016 on he is the Technology Lead for the Efficient Computing expertise area at the Netherlands eScience Center.
