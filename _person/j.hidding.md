Johan studied astrophysics at the University of Groningen, Kapteyn Astronomical Institute. He is finishing his PhD thesis on the dynamics of the large-scale structure of the Universe. In this work he used tessellation techniques from computational geometry to model and visualise the complex patterns that we find throughout the Universe.
