Rob received his PhD at VU University Amsterdam for work on "Efficient Java-Centric Grid Computing". Rob has designed and implemented the Manta, Ibis, Satin, and JavaGAT systems (now standardized in OGF as SAGA) and worked on the EU GridLab project, and the Dutch Virtual Labs for eScience project.

From 2009, Rob was a researcher at ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, where he designs and develops software for the real-time data processing of the LOFAR software telescope, the largest radio telescope in the world. This software runs on an IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer. Rob performed research on radio astronomy algorithms and pipelines for LOFAR and the exascale SKA telescope. Rob’s latest research focused on the use of many-core architectures such as GPUs for radio astronomy.

Since 2011, he is assistant professor at VU University Amsterdam, where he teaches many-core technology, and initiated the first and only CUDA Teaching Center in the Netherlands. If you are looking for an interesting masters project, please go here. Rob’s research interests include high performance computing, parallel and distributed algorithms, green computing, networks, programming languages, and compiler construction.

In May 2012, Rob joined the Netherlands eScience Center. Rob’s current position is Director eScience Technology. He is responsible for eScience Technology development in all projects, project leader of our eScience technology platform, and manager of the eScience Engineers.
