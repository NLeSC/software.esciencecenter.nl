Erik studied electrical engineering at the Delft University of Technology and obtained a PhD degree from the University of Groningen, after a project in which he compared three machine learning algorithms for building models for Dutch monosyllabic words. He successively obtained research and teaching positions as a computational linguist at the universities of Uppsala (Sweden), Antwerp (Belgium), Amsterdam (UvA) and Groningen, before joining the eScienceCenter as an eScience engineer in 2012. Erik is working on a project in which he develops tools for analyzing Twitter data.

I have a background in computational linguistics and have worked as a researcher and teacher at the universities of Groningen, Uppsala, Antwerp, Tilburg and Amsterdam (UvA). At the Netherlands eScience Center I am developing tools for analyzing messages from the social network Twitter. The target users for the tools are university researchers and students.
