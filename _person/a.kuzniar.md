Arnold studied Molecular Biology at the Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia. In the last year of his masters, he received a scholarship to study bioinformatics at the Wageningen University and Research Centre (WUR), the Netherlands. He completed his thesis on comparative genomics of White spot syndrome (shrimp) virus isolates. During this period he also developed bioinformatics tools to mine these genomes for epidemiologically relevant biomarkers.

Arnold obtained his PhD in Bioinformatics at the Laboratory of Bioinformatics, WUR. His PhD research was on scalable orthology-based cluster detection in fully sequenced genomes and on the integration of protein orthology/family data resources. In close collaboration with SURFsara, he used the Dutch Life Science Grid to compute a comprehensive map of corresponding (orthologous) proteins across species from all three domains of life.

In 2011 Arnold moved to Switzerland and joined the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Lausanne, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. He worked on an e-Science project aimed at speeding up the detection of positive selection in animal genomes using the Swiss Multi Science Grid (SMSCG).

In 2012 Arnold returned to the Netherlands and carried out research in computational proteomics at the Department of Genetics at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. Here he focused on reliable mass spectrometry(MS)-based detection of cellular responses (pathways) upon exposure to non-ionizing electromagnetic fields. To facilitate the MS data handling and statistical analyses, Arnold developed the PIQMIe proteomics web server.

At the Netherlands eScience Center, Arnold works on the ODEX4all and candYgene projects, which involve Linked Data/Semantic Web technologies, worlflows and Big data analytics.
