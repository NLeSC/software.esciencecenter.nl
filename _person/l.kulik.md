Lode holds a Master's degree in Conflict Resolution and Governance. That's where he learned to appreciate listening to different sides of a story. This appreciation slowly but surely turned into a passion for the field of communication. First at the EVS Foundation of the Dutch Labour Party, where he was communications manager. Later at Amnesty International's Movies that Matter, where Lode developed the digital communications strategy and an ambassadors program. 

In June 2013 Lode joined the Netherlands eScience Center as communications advisor.
