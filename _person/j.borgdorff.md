Joris studied mathematics and computer science at Utrecht University. He did his PhD on distributed multiscale computing at the University of Amsterdam in the Computational Science Lab. His thesis ranges from multiscale modeling methodology to the performance of distributed multiscale simulations; its application ranges from biomedical research to the simulation of fusion plasma physics. It also resulted in the public domain distributed multiscale simulation runtime environment MUSCLE 2. Because the research was embedded in the European MAPPER project, the formalisms and software found uptake in several application domains and grid middleware.

Before his PhD, Joris was a visiting researcher at SACEMA in South Africa to work on an epidemiological model combining HIV and TB disease dynamics. He adapted another model on sexually transmitted diseases so it was simulated with volunteer computing, using BOINC.

Joris joined the Netherlands eScience Center as an eScience engineer to work on the SIM-CITY project, aiming to combine disparate data sources to improve urban modeling. His interest is primed toward work that has an added value for society.
