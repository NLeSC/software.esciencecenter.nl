Lourens studied Computer Science at the University of Twente in
The Netherlands, where he received an MSc (Hons.) in Databases and Information
Systems in 2007.

He then joined the Computational Geo-Ecology group of the University of
Amsterdam as a scientific programmer on the NDFF-EocGRID project (Part of the
Virtual Laboratory for e-Science programme). Lourens led the design of the
data model and system architecture of the Dutch National Database of Flora and
Fauna (NDFF). The NDFF is a repository for species observations that is now
used by volunteer and professional observers to record their observations, by
governments to ensure compliance with EU nature protection directives, by
scientists for species distribution modelling, and by companies operating in
the Dutch landscape to assess potential risks to nature at a time when they
can still be easily and inexpensively mitigated.

Following this, Lourens continued at UvA as a PhD candidate in Computational
Geo-Ecology, working on the incorporation of dispersal limitations into
species distribution models, and fitting such models to observation data
using Bayesian techniques. He also worked with colleagues on processing
high-resolution global forest cover data into statistics on forest loss and
fragmentation, with the goal of investigating at which scales ecosystem
services are most affected by these changes.

While working on these projects, Lourens discovered a love for the
methodological and technical aspects of doing research, and in February 2016
he joined the eScience Center.
