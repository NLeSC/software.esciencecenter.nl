Carlos obtained his BSc in computer engineering at La Salle University in Mexico City. At the University of Exeter, he obtained his MSc in applied artificial intelligence and PhD on the topic of shape descriptors for image classification.

Carlos has worked on various research projects at the University of Exeter and Plymouth University in collaboration with industrial partners such as C3 Resources Ltd, eCow Ltd and the Met Office. These projects involved scientific research in the areas of video processing, machine learning and statistical modeling. The commercial outcomes of this research covered a wide range of applications such as automatic detection of abnormal energy consumption in buildings, video tracking of dairy cows, modeling high performance storage systems and segmentation of medical images. Before moving to the United Kingdom, he worked as a web developer and team leader at an eMarketing company, Interalia Digital, for different clients such as Coca-Cola Mexico, Coca-Cola Brazil and Nike Mexico.
