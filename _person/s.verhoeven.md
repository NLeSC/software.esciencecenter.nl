Stefan worked a decade within the Bioinformatics/Cheminformatics department in the pharma industry, where he administrated the Unix infrastructure and maintained/developed applications. Stefan helped scientists run their computations on clusters and maintained bioinformatics tools.
Most of the applications he made use a rich web interface or are web service based.

Stefan joined the Netherlands eScience Center as eScience Engineer, specialized in software development for life science projects.
