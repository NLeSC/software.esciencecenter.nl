Elena finished MS in Computer engineering and MS in Applied computer science at Technical University, Sofia, Bulgaria and worked for 2 years at the Institute of Information Technologies, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. In 2003 she received a PhD degree in Computer Science with specialization in image processing from Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland. Her thesis is dedicated to 3D texture analysis and modeling with application to MRI brain images.

Since 2003 she works in the Netherlands on variety of interdisciplinary projects and application areas. Between 2003 and 2007 she was at the Signals and Images group at Centrum Wiskunde en Informatica (CWI), Amsterdam, as a post-doctoral researcher. Elena worked on European and NWO projects for photo-identification of cetaceans and has developed an automated system used by the marine biologists in their research. A paper on saliency detector used for the photo-identification has been awarded a best paper award at GVIP' in 2005.

In 2007 she worked at the Multimedia group of the Dutch center for applied research TNO on object recognition tools for assisting the police investigators in their work. Between 2008 and 2012 she has worked as part of the R&D team of Prime Vision, B.V., Delft on OCR and indicia recognition projects for the postal industry. In 2012 Elena has also worked at the Software Engineering group at CWI on a project for automatic monitoring via camera and other sensor networks for assessing the risk of forest fires in cultural heritage regions of Southern Europe.

Elena joined the Netherlands eScience Center as eScience engineer in January 2013 to work on medical imaging and other multidisciplinary projects.
